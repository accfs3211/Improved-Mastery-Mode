<h1 align="center">Improved Mastery Mode</h1>
<p align="center">Based upon Ross-TheBoss's <a href="https://github.com/Ross-TheBoss/bloonarius-mastery-mode</a> Bloonarius Mastery Mod.</p>

Upgrades bloon ranks, replacing BADs and Fortified BADs with Tier 3 Bosses and Elite Bosses (Bloonarius, Lych, Dreadbloon, Vortex, Phayze). 

In order to change the game mode to mastery mode, click the Mastery Mode button in the Difficulty Selection screen.
 - Mastery mode's rules will apply on top of whatever vanilla game mode you choose (ABR, Half Cash, etc)
 - Selecting the game mode on the difficulty selection screen for maps will also apply Mastery Mode to Bosses, Challenge Editor, etc. I'm currently working on integrating the mode selection with the game mode change built into the Mod Helper so it can be accessed on other pages.
 - The game modes rotate beetween None, Mastery Mode, and Chaos Mode

In Mastery Mode:
 - Bloons will be upgraded x amount of times, where x can be changed in the mod setting under Promotion Times
 - BADs will be upgraded to a regular boss, with equal probability of any of the bosses being promoted, and Fortified BADs will be upgraded to the Elite variant

In Chaos Mode:
 - Bloons will be upgraded/downgraded at random up to x amount of times, where x can is the the same Promotion Times under mod settings
 - Bad promotion will work the same way as Mastery Mode

Mod Settings:
 - (Rounds early that cash per pop is reduced), self explanatory
 - (Promotion Times), as explained above
 - (Boss Progression), WIP, will change BAD promotions to the tier 1 of the boss variant, and allowing multiple Promotion Times to promote through the tiers
 - ({boss} speed), sets the base speed of the bosses when they spawn in, affected by freeplay rules
 - (Boss Toggles), WIP, will allow individual bosses to be toggled off

Cash Per Pop is reduced early (default 10) because of the amount of extra pops from bloon promotion
