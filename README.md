<h1 align="center">Improved Mastery Mode</h1>
<p align="center">Based upon Ross-TheBoss's <a href="https://github.com/Ross-TheBoss/bloonarius-mastery-mode"> Bloonarius Mastery Mod</a>.</p>

<h1>Mod Features</h1>

<p>Upgrades bloon ranks, replacing BADs and Fortified BADs with Tier 3 Bosses and Elite Bosses (Bloonarius, Lych, Dreadbloon, Vortex, Phayze).</p>

<h2>Mastery Mode</h2>

<p>To change the game mode to Mastery Mode, click the Mastery Mode button in the Difficulty Selection screen.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mastery mode's rules will apply on top of whatever vanilla game mode you choose (ABR, Half Cash, etc).</li>
  <li>Selecting the game mode on the difficulty selection screen for maps will also apply Mastery Mode to Bosses, Challenge Editor, etc.</li>
  <li>The game modes rotate between None, Mastery Mode, and Chaos Mode.</li>
</ul>

<h3>In Mastery Mode:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Bloons will be upgraded <i>x</i> amount of times, where <i>x</i> can be changed in the mod setting under Promotion Times.</li>
  <li>BADs will be upgraded to a regular boss, with equal probability of any of the bosses being promoted, and Fortified BADs will be upgraded to the Elite variant.</li>
</ul>

<h3>In Chaos Mode:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Bloons will be upgraded/downgraded at random up to <i>x</i> amount of times, where <i>x</i> is the same Promotion Times under mod settings.</li>
  <li>BAD promotion will work the same way as Mastery Mode.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mod Settings</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rounds early that cash per pop is reduced:</strong> Self-explanatory.</li>
  <li><strong>Promotion Times:</strong> As explained above.</li>
  <li><strong>Boss Progression (WIP):</strong> Changes BAD promotions to the tier 1 of the boss variant, allowing multiple Promotion Times to promote through the tiers.</li>
  <li><strong>Boss Speed:</strong> Sets the base speed of the bosses when they spawn in, affected by freeplay rules.</li>
  <li><strong>Boss Toggles (WIP):</strong> Allows individual bosses to be toggled off.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cash Per Pop</strong> is reduced early (default 10) because of the extra pops from bloon promotion.</p>
